# Programming design patterns and principles

(Implemented, using Java v17)

## Creational Patterns

### Factory Method:

> The Factory Method pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a
> superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It's a way to delegate the
> responsibility of instantiating objects to subclasses, promoting loose coupling between the client code and the
> concrete classes it uses.

### Abstract Factory

> The Abstract Factory pattern is another creational design pattern, like the Factory Method pattern, but it provides an
> interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. While both
> patterns deal with object creation, they serve different purposes, and the choice between them depends on your
> specific
> design requirements.

### Singleton

> A Singleton is a design pattern in software engineering that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single
> instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. In other words, it ensures that a class has only one
> instance in the entire application and provides a way to access that instance from any part of the code.

### Builder

> The Builder Pattern is a design pattern used in software engineering for building complex objects step by step. It
> offers several advantages and is particularly useful in situations where you need to create objects with many optional
> parameters or configurations.

### Prototype

> The Prototype Pattern is a design pattern used in software engineering to create new objects by copying an existing
> object, known as the prototype. It provides a way to create new objects with minimal effort and without the need for
> complex initialization logic.
